# Random data analysis of our trials_rows.csv
# Using data_parser.py


# Things that we want to learn:

# Average total number of steps for each maze for humans
# Average total number of steps for each maze for models

# Average human time, standard deviation

# Mazes changing over time
#   Find some way to represent the fact that the first 15 mazes have same exit locations
#   Second one has different exit locations
#   Graph, for one of our best models, human performance on each maze, maybe up then down

# How correlated is memoryless performance vs memory performance

# Previous models
#   Make the step cells equations
#   Make sure the other previous equations work on our mazes

# Run the previous models on the new mazes:
# * Expected utility
# * Discounted utility
# * Probability weighted utility
# * Combined
# * Heuristics

# Cool things to do:
# Track backtracking - did they do "left" then "right"
# See how similar human traversals are to each other
